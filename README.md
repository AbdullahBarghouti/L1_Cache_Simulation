# How to use

Use make to compile

Run with ./cache <mode #> <input>.txt

- Mode 0 runs the simulation and prints contents/stats when a 9 is in trace file

- Mode 1 runs the simulation just like mode 0 but also prints communication with L2 cache

- the <input>.txt file should consist of lines with the n command follwed by a 32 bit hex address "n ABCDEF12"
